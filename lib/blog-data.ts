- **Literature review**: Academic papers, books, reports
- **Existing datasets**: Government data, organizational records
- **Archival research**: Historical documents, case studies

### 4. Sampling Strategy

Explain your approach to selecting participants or data sources:
- **Population**: Define your target population
- **Sample size**: Justify your sample size with calculations if applicable
- **Sampling method**: Random, stratified, convenience, purposive sampling
- **Inclusion/exclusion criteria**: Who was included or excluded and why

### 5. Data Analysis Techniques

Describe how you analyzed your data:

#### Quantitative Analysis
- Statistical software used (SPSS, R, Python)
- Descriptive statistics
- Inferential statistics
- Hypothesis testing procedures

#### Qualitative Analysis
